## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
